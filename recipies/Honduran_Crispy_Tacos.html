    <h2>When it comes to making deep-fried appetizers, tacos hondureños are one of my favorites to make! crispy tacos. Serve topped with white cheese, onion sauce, or chopped cabbage.</h2>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <h3>Tacos</h3>

<li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

<li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>

<li>1 tomato, finely chopped

<li>1 green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>

<li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>

<li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper

<li>10 corn tortillas</li>

<li>vegetable oil for frying

<h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3>

<li>¼ cup water</li>

<li>1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

<li>½ teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>

<li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<li> the tacos: Place chicken breasts and salt into a pot and cover halfway with water. Bring to a boil; cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove from the pot and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Shred into thin pieces.</li>

<li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, tomato, and bell pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken, bouillon granules, and black pepper; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>

<li>Spoon some chicken mixture into the middle of each corn tortilla. Fold tortillas around the filling and secure with a toothpick.</li>

<li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tortillas in batches until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>

<li>Make the sauce: Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add tomato sauce, bouillon granules, and seasoned salt. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over tacos.</li>
