    <h2>PREPARATION</h2>

   <li> Chicken</li> 
   <p>Start by placing the chickens in a large covered bowl filled with water and adding salt to taste. Once the chickens are tender, incorporate a quartered onion, herbs, and a bulb of garlic, and let it cook for another 10 minutes. After cooking, allow the mixture to cool, then separate the chicken meat from the skin, bones, and innards, ensuring you have pure poultry for the filling.</p>

    <li>Salsa</li>
    
    <p>For the salsa, blend together tomatoes, two onions, a bulb of garlic, 1.5 bags of toasted relaxation (which I assume is a type of seasoning), green chiles, and achiote (a Salvadoran food coloring). Be sure to include the skin and other chicken parts, grinding everything into a smooth sauce. In a skillet, heat some oil and pour in the sauce, adding 4 ounces of chicken broth. Cook until it reaches a boil.</p>
    
    <li>Masa</li>
    
    <p>Prepare the masa by soaking corn and adding 1 cup of lime and enough water to cover it. Let this sit for about a day before making the tamales. After washing the corn, mill it until you achieve a consistent, smooth dough. Mix the dough with the remaining chicken broth, adding 4 ounces of broth, 3 cups of sauce, and 2 bottles of oil. If necessary, add more water to create a smooth paste. Cook over low heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spatula to prevent sticking. Allow it to cool.</p>
    
    <li>Filling Preparation</li>
    
    <p>Peel and chop potatoes into small pieces. Remove the veins from the beans and cut them into 1 cm segments. Slice the loroco and cut each piece in half, placing each ingredient in separate containers.</p>
    
    <li>Packaging</li>
    
    <p>Use banana leaves (usually sold fresh) and either sun-dry them for about 2 hours or quickly blanch them in boiling water to soften. Rinse them in water for sanitation, then gather them in small bundles for assembly.</p>
    
    <li>DESIGN Tamales.</li>

<p>A portion of banana leaf 30 x 40 cms (approx) is taken, and the center 1/2 cup dough is placed, a large hole opens in the center and is put 1 tablespoon of salsa, a good piece Meat, 3 pieces of potato, a gajita of lorocos (xóticos provide a taste and smell), some chopped green beans.
Is that this filling is the center, is wrapped and secured. If desired you can put 2 cm or 1/4 cheese egg (optional).
When finished wrapping the tamales are Boil about 1 hour, in a large, covered with water recently. They are quick cooking since most ingredients are cooked.
